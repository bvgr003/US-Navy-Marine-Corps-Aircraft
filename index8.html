            <p>
                The CH-53E Super Stallion is a heavy-lift helicopter used primarily by the United States Marine Corps. It is the largest and heaviest helicopter in the U.S. military, capable of carrying a wide range of cargo, including vehicles and artillery pieces, internally or externally. The Super Stallion features a seven-blade main rotor and three turboshaft engines, giving it impressive lifting capabilities. It is used for various missions, including troop transport, resupply, and combat support. The CH-53E has been in service since the early 1980s and has undergone several upgrades to improve its performance and maintainability. Its ability to operate in austere environments and transport heavy loads makes it a valuable asset for the Marine Corps' expeditionary operations.</p>
