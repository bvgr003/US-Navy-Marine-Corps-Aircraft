            <h1>E-2C Hawkeye</h1>

            <p>The E-2C Hawkeye is an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft used by the United States Navy and several other countries. It is known for its distinctive rotating radar dome mounted above the fuselage, which houses a powerful radar system capable of detecting and tracking aircraft and ships over long distances. The E-2C's primary mission is to provide early warning of potential threats and to manage air and naval operations by directing friendly aircraft and ships. It also has a secondary role in command and control, communications relay, and search and rescue operations. The E-2C has been a key asset for the US Navy, providing crucial situational awareness and command capabilities to carrier strike groups and naval task forces.</p>
