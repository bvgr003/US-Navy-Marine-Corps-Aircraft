            <p>
              The F-35B Lightning II is a state-of-the-art, single-seat, single-engine stealth multirole fighter aircraft. It is designed to perform a wide range of missions, including air superiority, ground attack, and reconnaissance. The F-35B is distinguished by its short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability, enabled by its powerful engine and innovative lift fan system. This feature allows it to operate from a variety of ships and austere bases, enhancing its flexibility and survivability in combat. The aircraft is equipped with advanced avionics and sensor systems, including the AN/APG-81 AESA radar and the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), providing the pilot with superior situational awareness. The F-35B is operated by the United States Marine Corps, as well as several international partners, and is set to become a cornerstone of modern air combat for decades to come.</p>
