            <h1>C-2A Greyhound</h1>

            <p>The C-2A Greyhound is a twin-engine, high-wing cargo aircraft primarily used by the United States Navy for carrier onboard delivery (COD) missions. It is specifically designed to transport personnel, mail, and supplies to and from aircraft carriers at sea. The aircraft features a spacious cargo compartment with a capacity of up to 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) of cargo or up to 26 passengers. Its high-wing configuration provides good visibility for the pilots, especially during carrier approaches and landings. The C-2A has a range of approximately 1,300 nautical miles (2,400 km) and is capable of operating from aircraft carriers using catapult launches and arrested landings. Its reliability and ability to operate in challenging maritime environments make it a crucial asset for supporting naval operations worldwide.</p>
