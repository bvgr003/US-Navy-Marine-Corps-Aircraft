            <h1>MV-22B Osprey</h1>

            <p>The MV-22B Osprey is a versatile tiltrotor aircraft used by the United States Marine Corps and Air Force Special Operations Command. It combines the vertical takeoff, hover, and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a turboprop aircraft. The Osprey can carry troops, cargo, and vehicles, making it ideal for a wide range of missions, including assault support, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel (TRAP), and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. The aircraft's unique tiltrotor design allows it to take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, and then rotate its engines forward for high-speed, fuel-efficient flight. The MV-22B is equipped with advanced avionics and defensive systems, making it a highly capable and survivable platform in complex and contested environments.</p>
